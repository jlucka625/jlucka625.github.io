	            <div class = "well">
	                <p>Hallowhoops is an annual event that takes place at the Lakeside Residential Complex at the University of Florida. It is a 
	                haunted house run by residents in the complex and gets the name "Hallowhoops" because it always takes place the day after
	                Halloween ("whoops" we missed Halloween). The theme this year was classic horror movie villains: Michael, Jason, Freddy,
	                and Ghostface. I chose this event for my project because it is something that I am a part of every year, and I wanted to take
	            	advantage of doing my project and helping for the event at the same time. The final poster was used as publicity for the event.</p>

	            <div class = "well">
	                <p>This was a group project for the non-majors graphic design class at the University of Florida. The goal of the project was
	                	to use the design thinking process to come up with a product solves a problem for the student body and/or local community.
	                	The problem we found was the accessibility of coffee on campus, particularly in terms of the amount of coffee locations 
	                	and the amount of time it takes to get coffee. Our solution was "The Bean Machine", a high-tech coffee vending machine
	                	that would be installed in various places around campus. My primary contributions to the project were the logo, and the
	                	design of the machine itself. </p>

        		<h2>PERSONAL BRANDING</h2><br>
	            <div class = "well">
	                <p>This project involved creating a professional logotype, resume, letterhead, and business card. For the logotype, we 
	                were required to type our names in at least 20 different fonts and recieve feedback for the top three. We then experimented
	                with alignment, size, position, color, etc for our names in those three fonts. Three of those experimental logotypes were
	                submitted for critique and the feedback was used to create the final logotype. The resume building process started with a 
	                research phase involving finding resume designs online and analyzing what we liked/didn't like. After two iterations, the final
	                resume was created. Address and phone number have been edited in these pdf versions for privacy reasons. </p>

        		<h2>NATIONAL AGRI-MARKETING ASSOCIATION (NAMA)</h2><br>
	            <div class = "well">
	                <p>In early Janurary I was requested to do logo design for UF NAMA. NAMA is a nationwide competition
	                	where students must form a team and market an agricultural product. Their original idea was
	                	"Red Diamonds", a premium strawberry, and it was requested to be cutesy and over-the-top. The team
	                	later decided to change the look to a more sophisticated feel, which is shown in the second design.
	                	Finally, the team decided to overhaul the Red Diamonds idea and market "Rosies". Rosies were meant to be marketed to children and families in the same style as Halos.</p>
