    						<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
    						<br>
	    					<p>Papercuts was developed by Team DigiSquid using Unity 3D in 2013 for CAP3020 Theory and
	    					Practice of Mutlimedia Production. As technical lead, my primary responsibility was to delegate
	    					programming tasks to myself and my team members and make sure the technical side of
	    					development went smoothly. All four team members were required to help with each aspect
	    					of the game, meaning I also had a part in desinging the game, making some 3D models/artwork,
	    					and creating sound effects.</p>
	    					<p>The game is about an ill boy named Ripley who spends his free time playing with his
	    					paper creation - Rip, a boy with a cardboard box for a head. At a critical point in Ripley's
	    					illness, he dreams that he is in a paper world and that he has taken the form of Rip. The
	    					evil Paper Witch seeks to turn his dream into a nightmare when she kidnaps his friends
	    					and family, and it is up to Rip to stop her.</p>

    					<p>I completed CAP3027 Intro to Digital Arts an Sciences in Fall 2012. The class
    					focused on basic computer graphics concepts, Java Graphics Library, Java Swing
    					API, and other concepts such as fractals and automata. To this day, I think this class
    					remains as one of the most interesting programming classes I've ever taken, and the
    					projects assigned to us were unique, challenging, and rewarding.</p>

    					<p>I completed CAP4730 Computer Graphics in Spring 2014. This class was the most
    					challenging class I've ever taken at UF. There was no other class the incorporated
    					so many concepts that I learned from previous classes. We were required to know concepts
    					from Calculus 3, Linear Algebra, Data Structures, and Computer Organization. </p>
