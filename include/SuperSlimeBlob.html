	<h1>Super Slime Blob</h1>
    <p>Super Slime Blob is a 2D Platformer game created with the Microsoft XNA Framework.
    The game started development in high school with a close friend of mine. A large majority
    of basic platforming mechanics were developed in high school. After graduating,
    I worked alone on the project and continued to add features, obstacles, enemies, 
    and designed all of the levels. The project was off and on for many years until
    Summer 2012 when I decided to finally see the game to its completion. The game is
    for PC only. Eventually, I hope to remake and improve the game (and also make it
    cross-platform or playable in a browser). Please enjoy my very first orignal video game,
    ever!</p>
