	<h1>Papercuts</h1>
	<p>Ripley is a young boy who suffers from a deathly illness. In his spare time he likes to create imaginary worlds and friends 
	from paper and glue. His favorite is “Rip”, a cardboard boy with a box- head. One night, Ripley has a bad flare up of his illness 
	and is put to bed. He wakes up in his backyard as Rip and realizes that everything is made out of paper. Waiting for him
	is his friend, Tess, who explains that the evil Paper Witch has kidnapped his family and is holding them hostage! As they begin 
	their rescue mission, Tess is kidnapped by the Paper Witch. With a pair of scissors in hand, Rip snips his way through the 
	paper world to defeat the Paper Witch and save his loved ones.</p>

	<p>Papercuts was developed by Team Digi-Squid for CAP 3020 "Theory and Practice of Multimedia Production". We created
	Papercuts using the Unity 3D engine. Links are provided below for the Papercuts main website, the design document,
	game download, and the web player version.</p>
